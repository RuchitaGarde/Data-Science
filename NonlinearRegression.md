### Comparison between non-linear regression models:
Neural Networks, SVM, MARS, KNN

I have used the 'permeability' dataset available in R package to perform a comparative analysis between the above 4 non-linear regression models. Please refer to the R script titled 'NonlinearRegression.R' for the code.

The packages you will need:
- `library(AppliedPredictiveModeling)`
- `data(permeability)`
- `require(caTools)`
- `library(caret)`
