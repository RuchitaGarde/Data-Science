This repository contains my research on data science models and algorithms, and other mini-projects.

- `NonlinearRegression.md`: This file contains a description about comparison between 4 nonlinear regression models: Neural Networks, SVM, kNN, MARS.
- `NonlinearRegression.R`: This is an R script file containing the code referenced in the 'NonlinearRegression.md' file.
- `RegressionTrees.md`: This file contains a description about regression trees.
- `RegressionTrees.R`: This is an R script file conaining code referenced in the 'RegressionTrees.md' file.
