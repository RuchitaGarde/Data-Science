### Regression Trees

I have used the 'solubility' dataset available in R to fit 2 simple regression tree models:
- A simple regression tree
- Random forest

I have only used a single predictor in the dataset `Molecular Weight` and built a visual for a better understanding of the regression tree. Please refer to the R script titled 'RegressionTrees.R' for the code.
